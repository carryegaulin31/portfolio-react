              Hello and welcome! I'm Carrye.
                <br className="hidden lg:inline-block" /> I love to build apps and try to learn something every day.

              <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
               Let me start off by introducing myself. My name is Carrye Gaulin and I am originally from Bangor, Maine. Don't let that fool you! I have ventured to farther off places. I have spent time living in various locations which include The U.S. Virgin Islands, the Florida Keys and the beaches of North Carolina. I love traveling to new places on exciting adventures. I love the sun, sand and any kind of fishing. Sounds nothing like sitting in front of a computer and creating does it? I have been interested in computers and what they can do since the first time I used one. From highschool I worked very hard to get into a computer science program at the University of Maine in Orono. Circumstances beyond my control abruptly removed me from that path. Full circle 20 years later I have returned, this time however, with a successful knack for sales coupled with an adult perspective and the same passion and curiosity for the pursuit of knowledge in the computer science field. The road is challenging but how much sweeter victory is after a good challenge.
